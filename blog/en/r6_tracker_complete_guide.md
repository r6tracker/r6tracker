Rainbow Six Siege is a game of millimeters and milliseconds. One pixel of peek advantage or a single second of drone placement can swing the round. The difference between a Gold and a Plat is rarely raw aim; it is the quality and speed of decisions. R6 Tracker, the community-favorite companion app from Tracker Network, turns every casual, unranked, and ranked match into a spreadsheet of actionable intel. Below is a complete, field-tested guide that moves from installation to high-level interpretation so you can turn raw numbers into rank-ups.

1. Installation & First-Time Setup  
   • PC: Download the Overwolf client, search “R6 Tracker,” and install. Overwolf auto-launches with Siege and overlays data in-game.  
   • Console: Use the web version (r6.tracker.network) on a phone, tablet, or second monitor.  
   • Privacy: Sign in with Ubisoft Connect so the app can pull your stats. If you prefer anonymity, you can search any player by exact Uplay name.  
   • Overlay settings: In Overwolf > Apps > R6 Tracker > Settings, set opacity to 60 % and bind a toggle hotkey (default Ctrl+F10). This keeps the panel visible but not intrusive when clutching.

2. The Three Core Tabs You Need to Master  
   A. Overview – “Where am I now?”  
      • Displays current season MMR, rank, top operators, and a rolling K/D, W/L.  
      • Use the “Season” dropdown to isolate recent performance. A 1.3 seasonal K/D but 0.9 lifetime K/D tells you you’ve improved; focus on replicating recent playstyle, not old habits.  
   B. Operators – “What should I pick next?”  
      • Sort by “Rating” (a W/L weighted index) to find your hidden gems. If you have 20 rounds on Osa with a 1.8 Rating but 100 rounds on Jäger at 1.0, you’re leaving free MMR on the table.  
      • Drill into each operator to see KOST%, Entry K/D, and First Kill %. These three metrics reveal whether you should anchor, lurk, or entry.  
   C. Weapons – “Where are my bullets going?”  
      • Headshot % and Shots-to-Kill (STK) show if your crosshair placement is improving. A high STK with low headshot % means you’re body-shotting; move crosshair higher.  
      • Compare your weapon stats to the global average. If your R4-C accuracy is 5 % above average but your K/D is average, you’re taking bad fights; reposition.

3. Live Match Tab – The In-Game Scouting Report  
   • Pre-round: Press your hotkey to see enemy ranks, top operators, and seasonal K/D. Instantly mark hard-counters on your mini-map notes (e.g., banning Thatcher if their #1 is a Thermite main).  
   • Post-round: The “Last Match” button shows who played what, their KOST, and which bombsite they attacked. Use this to adjust mid-set. If their Monty player went 0-4-0, you can ignore him next round and rotate.

4. Advanced Filters & CSV Export for Self-Coaching  
   • Filters: Under “Matches,” set Map = Clubhouse, Mode = Ranked, Role = Attacker. You’ll see your Clubhouse attack W/L and which operators you over/under-perform on.  
   • CSV Export: Click the download icon to pull 500-match datasets. Open in Excel or Google Sheets and create pivot tables: average KOST by bombsite, win rate by time of day, etc. Patterns emerge quickly; for example, a 38 % win rate on Clubhouse CCTV/Cash tells you to study pro VODs on that site.

5. Squad Analytics – Turning Five Individuals into a Team  
   • Share your Tracker links in Discord. Sort everyone’s operator pool by Rating to build a 6-pick flex roster. If your support player has a 2.1 Rating on Ace but 0.9 on Thermite, run Ace even on walls traditionally taken by Thermite.  
   • Track scrim results with the “Custom” tab. Input scrim scores and the app will compute round differential, attack/defense win rates, and momentum shifts (win/loss streaks of 3+).

6. Mental & Mechanical Drills Based on Tracker Insights  
   • If your Entry K/D < 0.8 but your KOST > 0.6, you’re dying early but still contributing utility. Drill dry-runs on T-Hunt Classic: drone, callout, entry, plant, die. Goal is to raise Entry K/D without losing KOST.  
   • If your headshot % is 15 % below the top 10 % of players, spend 15 minutes daily on Aim Lab’s “Six Siege Ultimate” playlist. Re-test weekly; aim for 0.5 % improvement per session.

7. Common Mistakes to Avoid  
   • Chasing raw K/D: A 1.5 K/D with 0.45 KOST is worse for the team than 1.0 K/D with 0.55 KOST.  
   • Ignoring sample size: A 75 % W/L on Warden over 4 rounds is noise, not signal.  
   • Static operator pool: The meta shifts every season. Re-evaluate your top 5 attackers/defenders after each mid-season patch.

8. Integrating Tracker with External Tools  
   • Discord bots: Add “Statbot” and link your Tracker profile; it auto-posts rank-up screenshots.  
   • OBS overlay: Streamers can add the Tracker overlay source so viewers see live MMR changes.  
   • Google Calendar: Schedule weekly VOD reviews based on your worst map or lowest KOST operator.

9. Case Study – Climbing from Gold 2 to Plat 3 in 30 Days  
   Week 1: Exported last 200 ranked matches, discovered 41 % win rate on Coastline. Banned it every game.  
   Week 2: Noted 1.9 Rating on Zofia but only 12 rounds played. Increased pick rate to 50 % of attack rounds.  
   Week 3: Used Live Match to dodge 5-stacks with 3+ Diamonds. Dodged 6 queues, lost 0 MMR to them.  
   Week 4: CSV showed 62 % attack win rate when planting within 1:30. Practiced faster droning; average plant time dropped from 1:47 to 1:18.  
   Result: +312 MMR, Gold 2 → Plat 3 with a 1.24 seasonal K/D and 1.17 seasonal W/L.

10. Final Checklist Before Queuing Ranked  
   ▢ Overlay opacity set to 60 % and toggle key bound.  
   ▢ Top 3 attackers/defenders by Rating memorized.  
   ▢ Worst map banned.  
   ▢ CSV export scheduled for next Sunday review.  
   ▢ Mental note: “Play for KOST, not K/D.”

Data is only noise until you give it context. R6 Tracker hands you the context on a silver platter; the rank-up comes from how ruthlessly you act on it.
